              <div class="flex-grow-1">
                  <p> I was 19 years old the first time I went to India. I stayed there during the summer volunterring in a slum school, learning more than I was teaching. Until today I don't know exactly what guided me there in the first place, but I was sure I was grasping something I needed for myself. I knew I had encountered a different place where I felt alive, perplex and intrigued in every single moment. 
                    I wanted to come back to that astonishment feeling, and there I went for six months, between my bachelor and master degree. During this complex and intense time I volunteer, I learnt, I traveled and brought with me lots of people, places but mainly the ability to love, compreheend and share with the other, as they do it so naturally in India. 
                    It was an experience that marked me and importantly something made in the right moment.</p>

                  <p>From North to the South many were the places I visited!</p>

                  <h5 class="my-3">Volunteering:</h5>
                    I went to India to volunteer as an english tutor. However, my experiences were not always really successful. 
                    Rapidly, I understood that a lot of the ONG in the field are more concerned of creating a bussiness model of social work than offering the best experience to the children in question. 
                    Nevertheless, after a first not so positive experience in Faridabad I joined Mariana (girl in the pictures), portuguese friend of mine, with her Nomad School Project. 
                    The project consistent in implementing a van school able to go to very isolated regions in South India, sharing different types of knowledges considered to be useful by the communities. For example, how to build a reusable pad, or how to build a filter water.
                    Check the video and pictures below, to understand better the project. Unfortunatetly, the project did not come to action as we were not able to raise enough money and because we faced big issues with the local ONG allocating the project.</p>
